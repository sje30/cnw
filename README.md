workshop.

Both sessions will be on Zoom (details to be emailed) and recorded for
those unable to attend.


## Part 1: Wed 11th November 10-12 (Stephen Eglen, sje30)

Introudction to modelling of single cells and small networks.  We will

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sje30/cnw/master?filepath=cnw.ipynb)

This uses an "cloud" instance of Julia, and so all you need is the web
browser and connection.  You will need to have a browser running at
the same time as the Zoom session so that you can follow along.


## Part 2: Fri 13th November 10-12 (Rafael Romero-Garcia, rr480)

For this session on analysis of brain networks you will need an
account on matlab online:

Please ensure you get an account (use your cambridge email) a few days
before the session.
